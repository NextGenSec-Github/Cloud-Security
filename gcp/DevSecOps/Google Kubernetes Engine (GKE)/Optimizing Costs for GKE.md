# Understanding Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Costs

## Introduction:
- Achieving cost optimization in GKE requires a comprehensive understanding of the cost structure and utilization patterns.
- This doc aims to explore various methods for gaining insights into GKE costs and implementing best practices to optimize spending effectively.
- Emphasis is placed on transcending the mere examination of GKE bills and focusing on deeper understanding and actionable strategies.


## Observing GKE Clusters:

- Organizations often have separate teams managing clusters and developing applications, necessitating collaboration to optimize costs effectively.
- The monitoring dashboard provides crucial insights into resource utilization and performance metrics.
- Cloud Operations, including Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting, offers detailed views into cluster metrics, aiding in identifying issues and optimizing resource usage.
- Utilization of the Infrastructure, Services, and Workload tabs provides different perspectives for analyzing cluster behavior.
- Custom charts created using the Metrics Explorer offer deeper insights into specific metrics such as CPU usage time by container.


## Logging and Monitoring:

- Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring offer observability into applications and infrastructure, with costs incurred based on usage and log retention duration.
- Increased logging and custom metrics lead to higher costs, necessitating careful management.
- Implementing multi-tenant logging with exclusion rules helps filter out irrelevant logs to minimize costs.

## Enable GKE Usage Monitoring:

- Enabling GKE Usage Monitoring allows automatic collection of granular metrics, exported to BigQuery for detailed analysis.
- Insights into CPU, memory, storage, and network usage facilitate comparison with allocated resources, identifying over-allocated resources.
- Namespace-based resource usage monitoring and utilization of labels for filtering enhance visibility into resource consumption and cost attribution.

## Kubernetes Resource Quotas:

- Kubernetes Resource Quotas enable capping resource usage at the namespace level, ideal for multi-tenant clusters.
- Limit ranges enforce resource limitations at the pod and cluster level, complementing Resource Quotas.
- Detailed metrics inform the setting of appropriate quotas, preventing resource over-consumption and potential cost spikes.

## Metrics Server:

- The Metrics Server collects and exposes metrics to the Kubernetes metrics API, aiding in autoscaling decisions.
- Maintaining the metric server's stability is crucial to prevent disruptions in autoscaling operations, necessitating careful monitoring and version compatibility checks.

## CI/CD for Cost Optimization:

- Reviewing configuration changes before deployment helps prevent unintended cost escalations, with tools like Anthos Policy Controller automating policy enforcement.
- Integration of policy validation into CI/CD pipelines using tools like KPT ensures continuous validation of configurations throughout the development cycle.

## Recommendation Hub:

- The Recommendation Hub provides actionable suggestions for optimizing costs based on usage patterns, spanning various aspects such as security and cost.
- Recommendations tailored to specific usage patterns offer insights into potential cost-saving opportunities, such as optimizing compute costs through long-term commitments.

## Conclusion:

- Visibility into resource utilization is paramount for effective cost optimization in GKE, enabling informed decision-making and proactive optimization efforts.
