# Access Control in namespaces
- Provisioning access to namespaced resources in a cluster is accomplished by granting a combination of IAM roles and Kubernetes' built-in role-based access control (RBAC).

- An IAM role will give an account initial access to the project while the RBAC permissions will grant granular access to a cluster's namespaced resources (pods, deployments, services, etc).
