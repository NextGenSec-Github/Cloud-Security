# Step 9: Secure Deployment Practices

Secure deployment practices are essential for ensuring the integrity and reliability of AWS Lambda functions throughout their lifecycle. This step focuses on strategies and best practices for securely deploying Lambda functions, managing deployment pipelines, and implementing infrastructure as code (IaC).

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Implementing infrastructure as code (IaC) allows you to define and provision AWS resources, including Lambda functions, in a repeatable and automated manner. Let's explore practical examples of leveraging IaC for secure deployments:

### 1. AWS CloudFormation

Use an AWS CloudFormation template to define the infrastructure and configurations required for deploying Lambda functions:

```yaml
Resources:
  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      Code: 
        S3Bucket: my-deployment-bucket
        S3Key: lambda_function.zip
      Handler: index.handler
      Role: !GetAtt MyLambdaExecutionRole.Arn
      Runtime: nodejs14.x
```
This CloudFormation template defines a Lambda function named MyLambdaFunction with the necessary configurations.

### 2. AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)
Leverage AWS CDK to define infrastructure using TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as lambda from '@aws-cdk/aws-lambda';

const myFunction = new lambda.Function(stack, 'MyLambdaFunction', {
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda'),
  handler: 'index.handler',
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
  role: myLambdaExecutionRole
});

```
