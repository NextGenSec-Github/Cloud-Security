Welcome to the getting started guide for implementing Zero-Trust security in a service-service architecture. This guide outlines some initial steps to get you started, but please note that it's a simplified introduction to a complex concept. You'll need to customize and expand upon these steps to match the specific needs and intricacies of your environment.

**Important Note:** The image provided above represents a typical service-service architecture that I am basing this guide off of. It's crucial to understand that Zero-Trust security is a general concept that can be applied to a wide range of architectures and scenarios.

## Introduction

Zero-Trust security is a framework that assumes no entity—whether inside or outside your network—should be trusted by default. Instead, it requires verification from anyone trying to access resources in your environment. This guide aims to help you begin your journey towards implementing this security model in AWS.

## Quick Start Steps

1. **Step 1:** [Improve your security posture using IAM authorization on the API Gateway](https://github.com/NextGenSec-Github/CloudSecurity/blob/main/aws/Zero-Trust%20on%20AWS/Implementing%20Zero-Trust%20for%20a%20Service-Service%20Architecture/API%20IAM%20Authorization.md)

2. **Step 2:** [Improve your security posture using API Gateway resource policy](https://github.com/NextGenSec-Github/CloudSecurity/blob/main/aws/Zero-Trust%20on%20AWS/Implementing%20Zero-Trust%20for%20a%20Service-Service%20Architecture/API%20GW%20Resource%20Policies.md)

3. **Step 3:** [Improve the security posture using VPC endpoint policy](https://github.com/NextGenSec-Github/CloudSecurity/blob/main/aws/Zero-Trust%20on%20AWS/Implementing%20Zero-Trust%20for%20a%20Service-Service%20Architecture/VPC%20Endpoint%20Policies.md)

4. **Step 4:** [Improve the security posture by tuning the VPC endpoint security group](https://github.com/NextGenSec-Github/CloudSecurity/blob/main/aws/Zero-Trust%20on%20AWS/Implementing%20Zero-Trust%20for%20a%20Service-Service%20Architecture/VPC%20Endpoint%20SG.md)

These are just initial steps to get you going. Remember to tailor your security implementation to your specific requirements.

## Customize for Your Needs

Zero-Trust security is not a one-size-fits-all solution. You will need to customize and adapt it to the unique characteristics and demands of your service-service architecture. As you proceed, consider factors such as the types of services you use, your organization's policies, and the specific security challenges you face.

For detailed and specific guidance, it's recommended to consult your organization's security experts or professionals with expertise in Zero-Trust security.

Please proceed with the guide, keeping in mind that this is a foundation upon which to build your own Zero-Trust security strategy and this is a good hands-on guide for people interested in this topic of security.

Best of luck with your Zero-Trust security journey!
