# Security Terms in DevSecOps

## SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- White box testing that analyzes source code for identifying security issues.
- Can be performed manually or with automated tools (Fortify, VeraCode, SonarQube).
- Utilizes source code checklists to identify security issues.

## Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
- Identifies third-party libraries used in source code.
- Evaluates license issues and security problems in these libraries.
- Tools like Snyk automate SCA for source code analysis.

## DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- Black box testing for web and mobile applications.
- Uses automated tools (e.g., Burp, QWASP ZAP, VeraCode DAST, WebInspec) to identify security issues.

## IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing)
- Combines aspects of SAST and DAST.
- Scans specific workflows within code to identify security issues.
- Addresses limitations present in previous testing methods.

## Infrastructure as Code (IAC) Security Testing
- Process of creating infrastructure using code files.
- Examples include cloud formation templates for AWS and Terraform for Azure and AWS.
- IAC Security Testing assesses security in these code files.

## API Security
- Focuses on identifying security issues within APIs.
- Also known as Security for Microservices.
- Distinguishes between APIs and microservices within a system.
- Explains the relationship between microservices and APIs.

## Conclusion
- These security terms are essential for comprehending DevSecOps.
- Each term plays a distinct role in ensuring security throughout the software development process.
