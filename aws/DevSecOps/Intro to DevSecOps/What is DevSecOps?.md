## Development Stage
- Implement security at an early stage of the software development lifecycle.
- Security implementation begins during the implementation phase.
- Use security tools to identify security issues in the source code.
- Define secure coding checklist in collaboration with developers.
- Follow the "Shift Left" approach to detect security issues as early as possible.
- Aim to prevent security issues from reaching the production stage.

## Operations Level
- Implement security measures in operations.
- Ensure only secure containers are submitted to the Container Registry.
- Identify and address security issues in existing containers.
- Conduct automated compliance scans for infrastructure.
- Implement frameworks and standards (e.g., PCI DSS for a credit card application).
- Utilize automation tools to ensure adherence to standards.

## Conclusion
- DevSecOps integrates security into both development and operations.
- Focus on early security implementation and continuous monitoring.
- Aims to prevent security issues and follows industry standards.
- Next lecture will cover the tools used in DevSecOps.

Hope you have a better understanding of what DevSecOps is now. Lets jump into some hands-on projects now!
