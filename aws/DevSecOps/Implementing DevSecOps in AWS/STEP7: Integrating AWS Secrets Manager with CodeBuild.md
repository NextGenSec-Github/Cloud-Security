# Integrating AWS Secrets Manager with CodeBuild
## Introduction
Welcome to this step where we'll enhance the security of our CodeBuild project by storing sensitive information in AWS Secrets Manager. We previously stored a SonarCloud token directly in our repository with the buildspec.yml file, but in real-world scenarios, it's a best practice to store such secrets in a secure service like Secrets Manager. Let's dive into the process!

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have completed the previous lectures, including creating a CodeBuild project and a SonarCloud token.

## Storing SonarCloud Token in Secrets Manager
1. Copy the SonarCloud token from your buildspec.yml file.

2. Open the AWS Secrets Manager service.

3. Click on `Store a new secret`

4. For `Secret type` choose `Other type of secret`

5. Provide a key-value pair:

   Key: `tokenForSonar` or your any key name of your choice

   Value: Paste in your SonarCloud token.

6. Click on "Next"

7. Enter a secret name (e.g., sonar-token-secret) and click on "Next"

8. (Optional) Enable rotation if needed and click on "Next"

9. Review the details and click on "Store"

## Updating buildspec.yml to Use Secrets Manager
1. Open your buildspec.yml file in the CodeCommit repository and click `Edit`.

2. Add the following section to the buildspec.yml file to retrieve the SonarCloud token from Secrets Manager:

```yaml
env:
   secrets-manager:
     TOKEN: yoursecretname:yourkeyofthesecretvalue               
```

3. Then in our buildspec.yml, we will replace our actual SonarCloud Token with this variable pointing to our secret in Secrets Manager. So our buildspec.yml file should look something like this:

```yaml
version: 0.1
env:
    secrets-manager:
      TOKEN: yoursecretname:yourkeyofthesecretvalue 
phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - mvn verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=yoursonarcloudprojectkey -Dsonar.organization=yoursonarcloudorg -Dsonar.host.url=https://sonarcloud.io -Dsonar.login=$TOKEN
```

4. Finally lets enter `Author Name` and `Email`, and commit the changes!


## Granting CodeBuild Permission to Access Secrets Manager
1. Open the IAM (Identity and Access Management).

2. Click on `Roles`

3. Locate and click on the role associated with your CodeBuild Build Project(e.g., CodeBuild-AWSProjectBuild-1-service-role). Alternatively, you can just go and click on your build project and under `Build Details` scroll down to `Environment` section and click on the service role link.

4. Under `Permissions` click on `Add Permissions` and from the drop down select `Attach Policies`.

5. Search for `SecretsManagerReadWrite` policy.

6. Attach the `SecretsManagerReadWrite` policy to the role by clicking `Attach Policy`.

## Testing the Build
1. Go back to the CodeBuild console and click on your CodeBuild Project

2. Trigger a new build in CodeBuild by clicking `Start Build`.

3. Monitor the build logs to ensure it retrieves the SonarCloud token from Secrets Manager.

4. Confirm that the build is successful and SonarCloud analysis is completed.

Congratulations! You've successfully integrated AWS Secrets Manager with your CodeBuild project, enhancing the security of your sensitive information. In the next step, we'll explore creating a build pipeline for a more streamlined development process.
