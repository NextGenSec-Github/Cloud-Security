# SonarCloud Documentation

## Introduction

SonarCloud, a powerful Software as a Service (SaaS) platform designed to enhance code quality and security in your projects. 

### What is SonarCloud?

SonarCloud is a cloud-based platform that facilitates the identification and resolution of code quality and security issues. It acts as a guardian for your source code, ensuring it remains free from various types of issues that might compromise its quality.

## Key Features and Benefits

### Code Quality Assurance

SonarCloud performs in-depth analysis on your source code, highlighting code quality issues, and providing actionable insights to improve overall code quality.

### Code Security

In addition to code quality, SonarCloud focuses on identifying and rectifying code security issues. This ensures that your codebase is resilient against potential security vulnerabilities.

### Customizable Quality Gates

SonarCloud allows you to define custom quality gates tailored to your project or organizational standards. This includes setting criteria such as code coverage and unit test coverage, enabling you to maintain higher standards than default settings.

## Integration with Build Systems

SonarCloud seamlessly integrates with your build system through its APIs. This integration enables you to automate the process of running quality checks on the source code generated by your developers.

### Cloud-Based Convenience
