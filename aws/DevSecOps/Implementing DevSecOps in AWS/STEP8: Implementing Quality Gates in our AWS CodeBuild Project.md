# Implementing Quality Gates in AWS CodeBuild Project

## Introduction
Welcome to this lecture where we'll implement a quality gate within our AWS CodeBuild project. A quality gate ensures that if SonarCloud identifies security or code quality issues within our source code, the CodeBuild project fails, allowing us to address and fix the issues before they impact production. In this demonstration, we'll be using SonarCloud, but similar principles apply to SonarQube.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you've completed the previous steps, including setting up AWS CodeBuild, integrating AWS Secrets Manager, and configuring SonarCloud.

## Implementing a Quality Gate in CodeBuild
To implement a quality gate in our CodeBuild pipeline, we need to make changes to our buildspec.yml file. Let's go through the required changes:
