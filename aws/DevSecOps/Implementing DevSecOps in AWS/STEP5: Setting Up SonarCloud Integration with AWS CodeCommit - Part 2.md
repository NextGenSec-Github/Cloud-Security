# Setting Up SonarCloud Integration with AWS CodeCommit - Part 2

### Introduction
Welcome to this step where we'll complete the setup for integrating SonarCloud with our AWS CodeCommit project. In the previous step(STEP4), we created a buildspec.yml file in our CodeCommit repository and left the placeholders empty. Now, we'll create a SonarCloud account, organization, project, and generate a security token to enable seamless integration.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have completed the STEP4, creating the buildspec.yml file in your CodeCommit repository.

## Creating a SonarCloud Account
Navigate to SonarCloud and sign up using your preferred method (GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, or GitLab).

If using GitHub, log in to your GitHub account when prompted to connect it with SonarCloud.
