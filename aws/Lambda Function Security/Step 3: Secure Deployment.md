# Step 3: Secure Deployment

Securing the deployment process of AWS Lambda functions is essential for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of your serverless applications. This involves ensuring that the deployment packages are securely handled and that the deployment process itself adheres to best security practices.

## Securing Deployment Packages

Lambda deployment packages typically contain your function code, dependencies, and any other resources required for execution. To secure deployment packages:

### 1. Dependency Management

Ensure that your Lambda function's dependencies are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities. Let's demonstrate how to use AWS CodeBuild for dependency management:

```yaml
# buildspec.yml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      python: 3.8
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - pip install --upgrade pip
      - pip install -r requirements.txt
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - python my_build_script.py
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`
```
This buildspec.yml file defines a CodeBuild build process that installs dependencies specified in requirements.txt before executing a custom build script.

### 2. Code Signing
Implement code signing for your deployment packages using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Here's an example of how to sign a deployment package using AWS CLI:

```bash
aws lambda sign --function-name MyLambdaFunction --key-id <KMS_Key_ID>
```
This command signs the deployment package of the Lambda function MyLambdaFunction using the specified KMS key.

### 3. Encryption
Encrypt sensitive data within your deployment packages using AWS KMS. Here's how to encrypt a file using AWS CLI:
```bash
aws kms encrypt --key-id <KMS_Key_ID> --plaintext fileb://my_sensitive_data.txt --output text --query CiphertextBlob > encrypted_data.txt
```

This command encrypts the contents of my_sensitive_data.txt using the specified KMS key and saves the encrypted data to encrypted_data.txt.
