# Step 3: Secure Deployment

Securing the deployment process of AWS Lambda functions is essential for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of your serverless applications. This involves ensuring that the deployment packages are securely handled and that the deployment process itself adheres to best security practices.

## Securing Deployment Packages

Lambda deployment packages typically contain your function code, dependencies, and any other resources required for execution. To secure deployment packages:

### 1. Dependency Management

Ensure that your Lambda function's dependencies are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities. Let's demonstrate how to use AWS CodeBuild for dependency management:

```yaml
# buildspec.yml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      python: 3.8
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - pip install --upgrade pip
      - pip install -r requirements.txt
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - python my_build_script.py
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`
```
