# Step 3: Secure Deployment

Securing the deployment process of AWS Lambda functions is essential for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of your serverless applications. This involves ensuring that the deployment packages are securely handled and that the deployment process itself adheres to best security practices.

## Securing Deployment Packages

Lambda deployment packages typically contain your function code, dependencies, and any other resources required for execution. To secure deployment packages:

### 1. Dependency Management

Ensure that your Lambda function's dependencies are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities. Let's demonstrate how to use AWS CodeBuild for dependency management:

```yaml
# buildspec.yml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      python: 3.8
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - pip install --upgrade pip
      - pip install -r requirements.txt
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - python my_build_script.py
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`
```
This buildspec.yml file defines a CodeBuild build process that installs dependencies specified in requirements.txt before executing a custom build script.

### 2. Code Signing
Implement code signing for your deployment packages using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Here's an example of how to sign a deployment package using AWS CLI:

```bash
aws lambda sign --function-name MyLambdaFunction --key-id <KMS_Key_ID>
```
This command signs the deployment package of the Lambda function MyLambdaFunction using the specified KMS key.

### 3. Encryption
Encrypt sensitive data within your deployment packages using AWS KMS. Here's how to encrypt a file using AWS CLI:
```bash
aws kms encrypt --key-id <KMS_Key_ID> --plaintext fileb://my_sensitive_data.txt --output text --query CiphertextBlob > encrypted_data.txt
```

This command encrypts the contents of my_sensitive_data.txt using the specified KMS key and saves the encrypted data to encrypted_data.txt.

## Integration with AWS CodePipeline
Define a CodePipeline build stage to compile your Lambda function code and dependencies. Here's a snippet of a CodePipeline pipeline definition in CloudFormation:

### 1. Build Stage
Define a CodePipeline build stage to compile your Lambda function code and dependencies. Here's a snippet of a CodePipeline pipeline definition in CloudFormation:

```yaml
Resources:
  MyPipeline:
    Type: AWS::CodePipeline::Pipeline
    Properties:
      Stages:
        - Name: Build
          Actions:
            - Name: BuildAction
              ActionTypeId:
                Category: Build
                Owner: AWS
                Provider: CodeBuild
                Version: '1'
              Configuration:
                ProjectName: MyCodeBuildProject
              RunOrder: 1
              InputArtifacts:
                - Name: Source
              OutputArtifacts:
                - Name: BuildOutput
```

This CloudFormation template defines a CodePipeline pipeline with a build stage that triggers a CodeBuild project (MyCodeBuildProject) to build the Lambda function code.

### 2. Test Stage
Include a testing stage in your CodePipeline pipeline to execute unit tests and security scans on your Lambda function code. Here's an example of a testing stage definition:

```yaml
        - Name: Test
          Actions:
            - Name: TestAction
              ActionTypeId:
                Category: Test
                Owner: AWS
                Provider: CodeBuild
                Version: '1'
              Configuration:
                ProjectName: MyTestProject
              RunOrder: 2
              InputArtifacts:
                - Name: BuildOutput
```
This stage triggers a CodeBuild project (MyTestProject) to execute unit tests and security scans on the Lambda function code.


### 3. Deployment Stage
In the deployment stage, securely deploy your Lambda function using AWS CloudFormation or AWS CLI. Here's an example of deploying a Lambda function using CloudFormation:
```yaml
        - Name: Deploy
          Actions:
            - Name: DeployAction
              ActionTypeId:
                Category: Deploy
                Owner: AWS
                Provider: CloudFormation
                Version: '1'
              Configuration:
                StackName: MyLambdaStack
                ActionMode: CREATE_UPDATE
                Capabilities: CAPABILITY_IAM
                TemplatePath: BuildOutput::template.yml
                RoleArn: <Deployment_Role_ARN>
              RunOrder: 3
              InputArtifacts:
                - Name: BuildOutput
```

This stage deploys the Lambda function using a CloudFormation stack (MyLambdaStack) with the specified template and deployment role.

## Implementing CI/CD Pipeline with Security in Mind

When designing your CI/CD pipeline for Lambda function deployment, consider the following security best practices:

- **Secure Credentials Management:** Store sensitive credentials and API keys securely using AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.

- **Audit Trail:** Enable AWS CloudTrail logging for your CodePipeline pipeline to track changes and monitor pipeline activity for security compliance.

- **Automated Security Checks:** Integrate security scanning tools such as AWS CodeScan or third-party solutions into your pipeline to automatically identify security vulnerabilities and compliance issues in your Lambda function code and dependencies.
